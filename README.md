# Haskell-Game-of-Life
### A simple functional implementation of Conway's Game of life in Haskell

The game of life involves configuring a cellular automaton and then observing how it evolves according to three rules.
The cells are organised as a two-dimensional grid, and are either live or dead. The three rules of evolution are:

  • Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
  
  • Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes alive.
  
  • All other live cells die, and all other dead cells stay dead.
